# 📅 Schedula

Schedula is a mobile productivity app built for students to manage their time, build healthy routines, and stay consistently productive — all in one place.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Schedula is designed to simplify the student experience by integrating key productivity tools into a single mobile app. It begins with a personalized onboarding questionnaire that collects information about the student’s routine (sleep, study, meals, etc.). Students can then import their school schedule via PDF or through course sites, which gets automatically added to their calendar.

Schedula analyzes the student’s free time and intelligently fills it with a balanced routine including:

🥗 Meals  
📚 Study sessions  
🧹 Chores  
🏋️ Exercise  
🛌 Sleep  

The app sends push notifications for upcoming classes, tasks, and events. Additionally, it offers:

📝 Quick notetaking system with organization tools  
⏱ Built-in Pomodoro timer for focused work sessions  
🎮 Gamified experience: earn XP, track streaks, unlock badges, and rise on the leaderboard
